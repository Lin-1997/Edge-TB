this file can generate a bw.txt suitable for class_node.py, Net.load_bw ().
you should provide the order of your nodes, the connection probability between nodes,
the maximum bw, the minimum bw and their unit.
we will ensure that the output is a connected graph,
so the proportion of nodes connected may be higher than the connection probability.
