	we parse this file like this:
	row1 in bw means: n1--inf-->n1, n1--4969kbps-->n2...
	row4 in bw means: n4--3195kbps-->n1, n4--without link_limit ()-->n2...

	the bandwidth between two nodes that without link_limit () depends on
	your physical network, and we will not block the network connection between them.
	
	we recommend you to treat two nodes without link_limit () as if
	they are not connected to each other.
	
	if you want to limit bandwidth between nodes with our link_limit (),
	you should run the worker/worker_tc_init.py in your containers and devices
	before running your apps.
	we recommend using the following file structure in your containers and devices,
	and use ['bash', 'run-app.sh'] as enter command of your containers and devices.
