Each node will no longer _Gossip_ after 30 rounds of training (`"sync": 30`), but it can still receive models from others
for training.  
p2 _Gossip_ after 4 local epoch trainings (`"epoch": 4`).

    "nodes": [
        {"name": "p4", "trainer_fraction": 0.2, "sync": 75},

    ]

```

The first node is the aggregator and other nodes are trainers.  
The aggregator uploads weights (actually completes training) after 75 aggregations (`"sync": 75`).  
In each round, the aggregator sends weights to about 20% of trainers (`"trainer_fraction": 0.2`).  
p2 uploads weights (if selected) after 3 local epoch trainings (`"epoch": 3`).

Breadth first traversal of layered structures.  
Line 1: when n1 (`"name": "n1"`) acts in the 3rd layer (`"layer": 3`), it uploads weights (actually completes training
because it's the top node) after 5 aggregations (`"sync": 5`). n1 has 2 child nodes (`"child_num": 2`) in the 3rd layer
including the nodes in the following two lines (n2 and n4).  
Line 2: when n2 acts in the 2nd layer, it uploads weights after 2 aggregations, and it has 2 child nodes.  
Line 4: when n2 acts in the 1st layer as trainer, it uploads weights after 4 local epoch trainings.
