	it takes a while to deploy the tc settings.
	when the terminal prints "tc finish", tc settings of all emulated and physical nodes are deployed.
	please make sure your node communicate with other nodes after "tc finish".

	you can send a GET request to ctl's /update/tc at any time
	to update the tc settings of emulated and/or physical nodes. 

	for example, curl http://192.168.1.10:3333/update/tc?file=links2.json
	the contents in this example links2.json are:

	{
	  "n1": [

	  ]
	}

	we will clear the tc settings of n1 and n4 and deploy the new one dynamically
	without stop nodes.
	for the above reasons, even if the bw from n1 to n2, n3, and n4 does not change,
	they need to be specified.
