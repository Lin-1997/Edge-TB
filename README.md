### Overview

EdgeTB is a hybrid testbed for distributed machine learning at the edge. It allows using Docker containers and physical
nodes to create hybrid test environments. On the one hand, the existence of physical nodes improves the computing
fidelity and network fidelity of EdgeTB, making it close to the physical testbed. On the other hand, compared with the
physical testbed, the adoption of emulators makes it easier for EdgeTB to generate large-scale and network-flexible test
environments.

### Installation

1. At least 2 computing devices, one acts as Controller, and others act as Workers (as physical nodes, class:
   PhysicalNode or as emulator, class:Emulator).
2. | |Requirement|
   | --- | --- |
   |Controller|python3, python3-pip, NFS-Server|
   |Worker (PhysicalNode)|python3, python3-pip, NFS-Client, iproute (iproute2)|
   |Worker (Emulator)|python3, python3-pip, NFS-Client, iproute (iproute2), Docker|
3. Copy ```controller``` into Controller and install the python packages defined in ```controller/ctl_req.txt```.
4. Copy ```worker``` into Worker and install the python packages defined in ```worker/agent_req.txt```.

### Usage

##### Workflow overview

Prepare roles, neural networks, dataset >> Define test environment >> Run it >>  Collect result.

##### Workflow detail

1. The only things you need to do in Worker is to run ```worker/agent.py``` with python3 with root privileges. We need
   to mount NFS and install python packages via ```python3-pip```, which require root privileges.
2. All the following operations should be completed in the Controller.
3. Prepare roles, just like what ```controller/dml_app/gl_peer.py``` does.
4. Prepare neural network model, just like what ```controller/dml_app/nns/nn_fashion_mnist.py``` does.
5. Prepare datasets and split it, just like what ```controller/dml_tool/nn_fashion_mnist.py``` does.
6. Update ```controller/dml_app/Dockerfile``` and ```controller/dml_app/dml_req.txt``` to meet your DML.
7. Prepare test environment ```controller/run.py```, see ```controller/ctl_run_example.py```  for more.
8. Prepare Runtime Manager, just like what ```controller/gl_manager.py```  does.
9. Run ```controller/run.py``` with python3 with root privileges and keep it running on a terminal (called Term).
10. It takes a while to deploy the tc settings, so please set your DML to start running after receiving a certain
    message, such as receiving a ```GET``` request for ```/start```.
11. Wait until Term displays ```tc finish```, and then start your DML.
12. Clear the test environment.

    result files. This function is defined in ```controller/gl_manager.py```.
12. Commands such as ```curl localhost:3333/docker/reset``` and ```curl localhost:3333/device/reset```are used to remove
